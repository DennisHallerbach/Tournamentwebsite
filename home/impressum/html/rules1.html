        <p>By participating in activities on LastHit.com, you agree to behave in a civil way towards others, including the administration team. Being part of LastHit.com means you represent us and the community through your interactions with others.

            <li>All matches are Bo1 (MR15) with Overtime (MR3) enabled.</li>

        <h1>FULL RULES</h1>

        <h2>MATCHMAKING STRUCTURE</h2>

        <h3>Matchmaking Format</h3>

        <p>All of the matches on LastHit.com are Best of 1 (Bo1).</p>

        <h3>Match Format</h3>

        <p>LastHit.com utilizes the single-game match format. A single-game match is played in a single game and places two players against one another. A game is played on a single map in a MR15 round format with the addition of Overtime if needed. For each half-time, teams/players play both terrorist and counter-terrorist, and score one point by winning one in-game round. The winner of a game is the first team which scores 16 in-game rounds. The winner of a match is the team that has won one game.</p>

        <h3>Overtime</h3>

        <p>If after 30 rounds both teams/players are tied, there is an Overtime which consists of a MR3 Format. If after 6 rounds there is not a winner, there will be a switch of sides and another MR3 will begin.</p>

        <h2>AGREEMETS</h2>
        <p>Even though we have rules in place for specific game modes, we will not act against opponents that come to different agreements. These agreements must not greatly differ from the rules put in place by LastHit.com. If an agreement is put into place before a match and results in a loss for you or your team, you are not allowed to report the agreement as being a disadvantage to your team.</p>

        <p>Any agreements made must be clearly stated before the match to both teams, and then written down in the match lobby. Rules that do not clearly state they can be changed by agreement, cannot have agreements made.</p>

        <p>Please also keep screenshots and/or logfiles of your arrangements. If you do not fulfil these requirements, any reports or supports concerning arrangements will be denied.</p>

        <h2>GAME COVERAGE</h2>

        <p>Due to the nature of LastHit.com, we reserve the right to the coverage of matches conducted on the LastHit.com platform. CME.GG can assign the coverage rights of a match or of several matches to a third party or to actual players themselves via the Arena page.</p>

        <h2>PLAYER SETTINGS</h2>

        <h3>Illegal software and hardware tools</h3>

        <p>Programs that provide any type of advantage during game play (e.g. drivers that allow the removing of walls) are forbidden. Any programs that change the game itself are forbidden and any user caught using such software will be subject to punishment.</p>

        <h3>Bypassing of Anti-Cheat</h3>
        <p>Any attempt to bypass our anti-cheats will result in a permanent ban on the CME.GG platform.</p>

        <h3>SteamID</h3>
        <p>Any user of the LastHit.com platform must link their CS:GO SteamID upon registering otherwise you will not be able to join a server. If you are having issues with linking your SteamID, please contact our support team via support@LastHit.com</p>

        <p>Please Note: Once linked, a SteamID cannot be unlinked.</p>
